  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p><span>When I was a kid, I believed that a person is supposed to figure out what they wanted to do for the rest of their life, go to a school to learn how to do that thing, and then spend their life happily doing the thing. I think a lot of us did. I could not have been more wrong.</span>
  <span>What I know now is that all the little seemingly-disparate experiences over the years have added up to something so much more. I’ve studied mathematics and theater, served coffee and tested code, been a bank teller and a product manager. Through it all there has been one unifying theme: I want to solve people’s problems, and I have the skills to do so.</span>
  <span>I build awesome products that solve people’s problems. I research, ask, and learn. I build and test and sometimes fail and try again. My diverse background is my greatest strength, allowing me to identify problems, empathize with users, analyze and gather the necessary data, and find creative solutions.</span></p>
